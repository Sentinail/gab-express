# Running Gab Express - Web Donation Platform

Gab Express functions as a charitable online platform where users have the opportunity to offer assistance to individuals requiring support, while also being able to view a community engagement leaderboard.

To run the project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   If you haven't already cloned your project repository, use Git to clone it to your local machine. You can clone it from the GitHub repository URL:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Sentinail/gab-express.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project.
   ```
   cd gab-express
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Before running the project, you need to install its dependencies. Use npm (Node Package Manager) for this. Run the following command to install the necessary packages and libraries:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server:**
   After installing dependencies, start the development server by running the following command:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   This command will start the development server and open a new browser window or tab with your project. You can access it at `http://localhost:3000` by default.

5. **Access the Application:**
   You can now access and interact with your web donation platform via your web browser. Any changes you make to the code will automatically trigger hot-reloading, allowing you to see the changes in real-time.

6. **Production Build (Optional):**
   When you're ready to deploy your project to a production server, you can create a production build using the following command:
   ```
   npm run build
   ```
   This command will create an optimized and minified version of your project in the `build` directory. You can then deploy this build to your production server.

That's it! You've successfully run your Gab Express web donation platform on your local machine. Remember to make sure you have Node.js and npm installed, as they are prerequisites for running Create React App projects.

Feel free to explore and contribute to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/Sentinail/gab-express.git) for this project.
